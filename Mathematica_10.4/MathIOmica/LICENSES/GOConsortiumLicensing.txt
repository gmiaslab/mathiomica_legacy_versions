GO Data
If you wish to cite data provided by the Gene Ontology project, either from AmiGO or the files downloaded from the GO website, please state the release date and/or version number of the data. Both annotation and ontology data may change over time, and to reproduce the results of an analysis, it is important that the same initial GO data is used.

Ontology files
Metadata is stored at the top of the ontology file; please state the date of the file and the CVS revision number.

Gene Association files
Please cite the GOC validation date and the CVS revision number, both of which can be found in the first few lines of a gene association file.

Database
Release information can be found in the instance_data table in the database. Please state both the release date and the release type.

Data from AmiGO
The database release can be found in the page footer on the right-hand side. To cite the annotations of individual database groups please see the GO publications list.
